This is a Master project undertaken in the guidance of Mr. Abu Hasan who is himself a researcher and working in University of Siegen.
The project focuses on the intrepretability of model. In todays Covid world we have hospitals running out of their capacities. 
So it would be very helpful if we have preliminary diagnosis which can reduce the load on the hospitals and resources are utilized 
in treating the critical patients in the situation like this.
